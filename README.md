## Getting Started üèÅ

Before you try to set up this app, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Ruby (3.0.2)
- Node (16.3.0) + Yarn
- Postgres (13.3)
- [Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) for managing multiple servers

You must also fork and clone this repository.

For help getting set up, refer to the [Contributor Resources](#contributor-resources-) section of this document.

### 2. Setup the repo
To install dependencies and setup the database, run:

```
make setup
```

### 3. Run the tests
- To run the backend tests: `rspec`
- To run the frontend tests: `yarn jest app/javascript`

### 4. Start the server
To start both the frontend and backend servers at the same time, run:

```
foreman start
```

In your browser, navigate to `localhost:5000` to see the app in action!

Alternatively, you may run the frontend and backend servers separately with these two commands:

```
rails s
bin/webpack-dev-server
```

This may be helpful for debugging, but generally should not be necessary.

### 2. Write your code and create a pull request
- Note that your pull request may require one or more tests. Tests are required for almost all backend changes, and all frontend logic-related changes. Style or copy changes do not require you to write a test.
