            Members use the interview prep space to organize sessions to practice for technical
            interviews. The Jobs channel is available for members to post job openings at their
            companies. Members who post jobs are often willing to share more about the companyâ€™s
            culture, etc. It is free for members to post and several WNB.rb members have found their
            next job via the community.
